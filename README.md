## Features

- Route optimization for low carbon emissions
- GAN-based scenario generation for future logistics challenges
- Interactive map visualization of routes and emissions
- Consideration of multiple constraints:
  - Vehicle type and fuel efficiency
  - Road conditions and traffic
  - Weather conditions
  - Load capacity
  - Time windows
  - Multiple stops

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
